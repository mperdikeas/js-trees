# js-trees
Simple tree structures and traversal algorithms in JavaScript.

Requirements were driven solely by the need to use such trees in the context of a min-max
optimization algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning) so I am unsure how well they cope for
other use cases.

Naturally, the implementation of the trees is not tainted by domain-specific concepts of
any particular use case (in this case the min-max algorithm).
